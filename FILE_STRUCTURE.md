# File structure explanation

## **public/:** 
Contains static assets served directly by the web server (images, etc.).

## **src/:**
The heart of your application code.

## **App.js:**
The root component of your application.

## **main.js:** 
The entry point that renders the App component into the DOM.

## **assets/:** 
Stores static assets used within your components (images, fonts).

## **components/:** 
Houses your React components. It's further organized:

### **auth/:** 
Components related to authentication (login, registration).

### **dashboard/:** 
Components specific to the user dashboard.

### **common/:** 
Reusable UI components used across different parts of the application. This promotes consistency and reduces code duplication.

### **layout/:** 
Components that define the overall structure of your pages (navigation, sidebars, footers).

## **hooks/:** 
Custom React Hooks to extract component logic and make it reusable.

## **pages/:** 
Container components that represent different views or screens of your application. They typically fetch data and compose components.

## **services/:** 
Contains functions for interacting with your backend API. Each file ideally focuses on a specific resource or domain. An api.js file can handle base URL configuration and error handling.

## **store/:** 
All files related to your state management solution (Redux, Zustand, Context API). The structure within this folder will depend on the chosen library.

## **utils/:** 
Utility functions that are not specific to any particular component or domain (helper functions, validation logic, data formatting).

## **router/:** 
Configuration for your application's routing (using libraries like React Router).

## **theme/:** 
Defines your application's visual style (colors, typography, global styles). This makes it easier to maintain a consistent look and feel.

## **tests/:** 
Contains your unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, mirroring the source code structure for better organization.

## **.env:** 
Environment variables for your application.

## **.gitignore:** 
Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore.

## **package.json:** 
Contains metadata about your project and lists its dependencies.

## **README.md:** 
A file providing an overview of your application.
